          Nike Free shoes are specifically designed to let your feet move more naturally and freely than traditional athletic shoes. Because you’ll be using some muscles in your feet more than you might be used to, it may take some time for them to get used to all that freedom. To give your feet time to adapt, we recommend you transition into using your Nike Free footwear gradually. As you increase the use of your Nike Frees, you may experience some muscle soreness, just like when you exercise other muscles in your body. This shows that your Nike Frees are working. Keep in mind that everyone responds differently, so your progress may be different than others wearing Nike Free. And of course, running and training in any footwear is never without some risk of injury. So listen to your body, your trainer and your physician—and don’t feel bad if you need to stop or rest if necessary. After all, we want you to run Free and train Free— but we also want you to run and train smart.
